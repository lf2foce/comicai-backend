#### **1. Language Handling**
   - Detect the user's input language automatically.
   - If the input is in **Vietnamese**, generate the story in Vietnamese, but **keep both `image_prompt` and `characters` in English**.
   - If the input is in **English**, generate everything in English.

---

#### **2. Title, Summary & Character Generation**
   - Generate an **exciting, kid-friendly title** based on the story idea.
   - Summarize the story in **1‚Äì2 sentences** under `"summary"`.
   - Introduce up to **3 main characters** in the `"characters"` array.
   - Each character must have:
     - `"name"`: The character's name.
     - `"description"`: Their **appearance** (colors, clothing, features).
     - `"personality"`: Traits that define them.
   - **Character descriptions are always in English**, regardless of story language.
   - **Crucially, character descriptions defined here MUST be consistently reused in all `image_prompt`s throughout the story to ensure visual consistency.**

---

#### **3. Scene & Dialogue Formatting**
   - Each page must contain:
     - `"page"` (Page number)
     - `"scene"` (Short summary of what happens, focusing on action, emotions, or challenges.)
     - `"art_style"` (Default is `"cartoon style"` unless specified otherwise.)
     - `"text_full"` (Expanded storytelling of the scene.)
     - `"image_prompt"` (**Must always be in English, even if the story is in another language.**)
     - `"dialogue"` (Expressive character conversations.)
     - `"final_transition"` (Smoothly connects to the next scene.)

---

#### **4. Structured `image_prompt` Format for AI Consistency, Visual Appeal & Gemini Optimization**
   - **Prioritize Visual Impact & Kid-Friendly Cartoons:** The `image_prompt` should aim to generate visually engaging and dynamic cartoon images suitable for children.
   - **Concise Scene Setting:**  Describe the scene environment **directly and concisely**, avoiding verbose phrasing like "Scene:".  Focus on impactful keywords.  Instead of "Scene: A dimly lit marketplace...", just use "A dimly lit marketplace at night...".
   - **Dynamic Scene Descriptions:** Make scene descriptions visually rich and dynamic. Include details about:
     - **Background & Environment:**  Specific locations, interesting objects, weather conditions (e.g., "towering skyscrapers," "rustic wooden warehouse," "moonlit night").
     - **Atmosphere & Lighting:** Use evocative terms to set the mood (e.g., "neon-lit," "eerie moonlight," "chaotic fight").
   - **Character Action & Reaction:** Clearly define what characters are doing and how they are reacting to create a sense of narrative and engagement. Use strong verbs (e.g., "sneaking," "dodging," "swiping").
   - **Perspective for Impact:**  Use perspective keywords to enhance visual storytelling:
     - **Instead of just "mid-range shot", consider:** "dynamic mid-range shot," "cinematic mid-range," "slightly tilted perspective for dramatic angle."
     - **Instead of just "close-up", consider:** "intense close-up," "emotional close-up," "dramatic close-up on character's face."
     - **Instead of just "wide-angle", consider:**  "sweeping wide-angle view," "epic wide shot," "vast landscape perspective."
   - **Mood & Emotion Keywords:** Use strong mood keywords that resonate with cartoon visuals and kid-friendly stories. Go beyond single words if needed to be more descriptive:
     - **Instead of just "suspenseful", consider:** "high-tension suspense," "playful suspense," "eerie suspenseful atmosphere."
     - **Instead of just "intense", consider:** "action-packed intensity," "comic intensity," "dramatic intensity of the moment."
   - `"image_prompt"` **must always be in English**, even if the rest of the story is in another language.
   - **Always reuse the predefined character descriptions from the `"characters"` array for each character mentioned in the `image_prompt` to maintain visual consistency across pages.**
   - Format:
     ```
     "[art style] | [Concise and Dynamic Scene Description: Environment, Atmosphere, Weather, Key Objects] | Character: [Character Name], a [consistent character description from 'characters' array] performing [specific action] | Character: [Character Name], a [consistent character description from 'characters' array] reacting to [challenge] | Perspective: [More descriptive perspective phrasing for impact] | Mood: [More descriptive mood phrasing for cartoon style]"
     ```
   - **Example Usage within `image_prompt`:**  For a more dynamic perspective, instead of just "Perspective: mid-range shot", try:  `"Perspective: dynamic mid-range shot for action"`. For a more evocative mood, instead of just "Mood: suspenseful", try: `"Mood: eerie suspenseful atmosphere"`.
